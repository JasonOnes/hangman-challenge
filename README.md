# hangman-challenge

In order to run this program locally you will need to have Python 3 installed.
It's written in 3.5 but any 3 version should work though I'm not sure about the back compatibility
with Python 2.X.

In the folder you've designated, set up a virtual environment.
I used virtualenv this morning but if you prefer pipenv, pyenv, or venv go for it. 
Here's a quick link(s) if you're not familiar:

[2] http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html



Once you have that setup and activated you can run:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
to run the program simply:
python hangman.py

## I may update this readme later if neccesary but I'm out of time!!
